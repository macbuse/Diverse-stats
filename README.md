It's a standard of statistics that athlete's birthdays aren't uniformly distributed over a year.

#### What about singers?

data source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:20th-century_American_singers

#### What about their death dates? 

The question here is a commercial one: <br>
Do the deaths of performing artists die occur more frequently **just** before Xmas? <br>

This would be advatageous for their record company given the expected peak in sales over the "giving season".
